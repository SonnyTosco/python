Basic Form Validation

Most important concepts:
- Logic
  - what data do we want to validate?
- Checking if the data is present
- Making sure the data is in the correct format
- Sending fhe user to the correct destination whether their data is valid or not
- Alerting the user of their errors (if they exist)

Getting Started
- most important to know how to do the if/else statement
- form validation centers around using if statements combined with functions
that return TRUE or FALSE depending on the data we give them

Validation Step 1- Conditionals
- every validation is conditional
- Pseudo code would look like:

If the name field in the POST data is empty
  Display validation error
Else:
  display success message

How should we check if the name field is empty? This is where the handy built-in
python function "len()" comes in!

Len ()
The len function takes in a string as an argument and returns the length of the string

Validation Step 2- Flash Messages on the server
- flash messages are strings that exist for one redirect cycle
  - similar to session, you can access flash messages through embedded
  python tags {{}} & {%%} on the views and display them to the user

Validation Step 3- Flash emssages on the client
- Flash helps us with flash meesages by giving us access to a function on the client side that allows
us to get all flash messages as a list
- the function to use this is "get_flashed_messages()". Example below

<html>
<head>
  <title>Basic Validation Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Enter a Valid(Any) Name!</h1>
  {% with messages = get_flashed_messages() %}
    {% if messages %}
      {% for message in messages %}
        <p>{{message}}</p>
      {% endfor %}
    {% endif %}
  {% endwith %}
  <form action='/process' method='POST'>
    Name:<input type="text" name="name">
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
  </form>
</body>
</html>

A lot is happening in the code that we added. Let's go over it line by line

{% with messages = get_flashed_messages() %}
  The with messages here helps us declare a variable in our template that we can use within a specific scope.
{% if messages %}
  Check if there are even any messages that came back from the get_flashed_messages() function
{% for message in messages %}
  Loop through all messages
<p>{{message}}</p>
  Print the messages one by one each in a paragraph tag
