Create a program that prints all the odd numbers from 1 to 1000.
Use the for loop and don't use array to do this exercise.

for count in range (1,1000):
...     if(count%2==1):
...             print count

Create another program that prints all the multiples of 5 from 5 to 1,000,000.

for count in range (5,1000000):
...     if (count%5==0):
...             print count

Create a program that prints the sum of all the values in the list:
a=[1,2,5,10,255,3]
b=sum(a)
print b

Create a program that prints the average list of values in the list:

a = [1, 2, 5, 10, 255, 3]
b=sum(a)
c=b/len(a)
print c
