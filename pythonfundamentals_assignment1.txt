Create a program that prints all the odd numbers from 1 to 1000.
Use the for loop and don't use array to do this exercise.

for count in range (1,1000):
...     if(count%2==1):
...             print count

Create another program that prints all the multiples of 5 from 5 to 1,000,000.

for count in range (5,1000000):
...     if (count%5==0):
...             print count
