Flask Notes

Basic Routes
- a route is a handler for a particular HTTP request
- when an HTTP request hits a server, the server checks to ee whether it can handle the request (aka route)
  - the route then runs and sends an appropriate HTTP response
- if no route is explicitly mentioned, it is a GET route
  - GET routes will mostly be used for serving pages or rendering templates.
- every route has two parts
  - HTTP verb(GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
  - URL

  /hello_flask/hello.py
  note the addition of render_template -- that allows us to return the rendered html that we created above!

  from flask import Flask, render_template  # Import Flask to allow us to create our app, and import
                                            # render_template to allow us to render index.html.
  app = Flask(__name__)                     # Global variable __name__ tells Flask whether or not we
                                            # are running the file directly or importing it as a module.
  @app.route('/')                           # The "@" symbol designates a "decorator" which attaches the
                                            # following function to the '/' route. This means that
                                            # whenever we send a request to localhost:5000/ we will run
                                            # the following "hello_world" function.
  def hello_world():
    return render_template('index.html')    # Render the template and return it!
  app.run(debug=True)                       # Run the app in debug mode.
  Here you can see that we are handling the '/' route with the hello_world function which
  renders the index.html template. Here the HTTP verb is "GET".

Route Structure
- we can write routes like this:
@app.route('/some_route')
def some_function_name():
  // your code here
