Cookies and Sessions

Cookies
- used to enhance the user experience
- client-side files that contain user information
- these are stored in the user's browser

Sessions
- used to allow you (the dev) to create some levels of security all throughout
your web application
- server-side files that contain user information
- stored on the server, which means clients do not have access to the information
stored by them
- work like a token, allowing access and passing information while the user has
their browser open

In summary:
- session is a way to store information unique to a particular client on the server side
- session uses cookies to identify the client who's session we are interacting with
- when you want to access and modify data over multiple redirects use session
- you can use session in both your server.py file as well as your templates
- even though you have access to the session, you should not abuse the amount
of information you store in it. Store only what you need in the session
